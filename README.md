Networks and Distributed Systems Project 4 - Reliable Transport

HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our high-level approach builds off of the starter code that we were given.

CHALLENGES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the challenges that we faced dealt with how to implement certain things. To name a few, we got stuck on how to implement a sliding window, how to check for corrupted packets, and how to _____. We were able to solve these issues by reading over the slides and doing external research on the TCP protocol. So, we realized that we needed to do a checksum for corrupted packets, a ___ for ____, etc.

GOOD FEATURES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We tested our code by running the tests in the configs folder very often. This would let us know if we were on the right track, or we were completely wrong. Also, sometimes tests that were previously working, stopped working after some changes so it was helpful to keep our code correct. Alongside that, we also used print statements wherever we needed so that we could see what was going on with the internal workings of our code.
